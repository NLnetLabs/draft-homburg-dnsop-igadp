        Implementation Guidelines for Authoritative DNS Proxies
                      draft-homburg-dnsop-igadp-00

Abstract

   In some situations it can attractive to have an authoritative DNS
   server that does not have a local copy of the zone or zones that it
   serves.  In particular in anycast operations, it is attractive to
   have a great geographical and topological diversity.  However,
   sometimes the expect use of a particular site does not warrant the
   cost of keep local copies of the zones up-to-date.  This can be the
   case if the zone is very big or if the anycast cluster serves many
   zones and only a few on them are expect to get significant use.  In
   these cases it is attractive to have a proxy serve some or all of the
   zones.  The proxy does not have a local copy of the zones it serves,
   instead it forwards request to another server tat is authoritaive for
   the zone.  The proxy may have a cache.  This document describes the
   details of such proxies.

2.  Introduction

   In some situations it can attractive to have an authoritative DNS
   server that does not have a local copy of the zone or zones that it
   serves.  In particular in anycast operations, it is attractive to
   have a great geographical and topological diversity.  Benefits of an
   extra site can be reduced latency, DDoS protection by serving a zone
   locally and thus be protected from a DDoS that originates in other
   parts of the network, and DDoS mitigation by attracting local DDoS
   traffic.

   However, sometimes the expect use of a particular site does not
   warrant the cost of keep local copies of the zones up-to-date.  This
   can be the case if the zone is very big or if the anycast cluster
   serves many zones and only a few on them are expect to get
   significant use.

   In these cases it is attractive to have a proxy serve some or all of
   the zones.  The proxy does not have a local copy of the zones it
   serves, instead it forwards request to another server tat is
   authoritaive for the zone.  The proxy may have a cache.

   A proxy can operate in two basic modes: with or without cache.
   Without a cache, the proxy forward each incoming request to another
   that is authoritative for te domain.  This is very simple, but also
   provides limited benefits.

   With a cache the proxy becomes more complex.  The reason is that we
   want the proxy to behave like an authoritative server, i.e. provide
   similar behavior with respect to TTLs and data consistency.

   Another issue that may complicate matters is the EDNS Client Subnet
   option.

3.  Basic Requirements

   The proxy MUST drop replies with the AA bit clear.  The reasoning is
   that the proxy may accidentally reach a recursive resolver.

   The proxy sends requests upstream with RD bit clear.

   The proxy sends replies to clients with the original TTL.  Caching is
   not controlled by TTL but by the parameters in the SOA record.

4.  Cache replacement

   The goal of the cache replacement strategy described here is mimic
   the behavior of a standard secondary as much as possible.

   The basic idea is that the proxy fetches SOA records just like a
   secondary would do based on the parameters in the SOA record, in
   response to a NOTIFY and taking the contents of the EXPIRE option RFC
   7314.

   Cache entries are tags with the zone serial number from the most
   recent SOA record.  A cache entry is valid only when the serial
   number in the cache entry match the serial number of the current SOA
   record.

   When a new SOA record arrives with a higher serial number there are
   two options.  The first option is to take this as the new current SOA
   record.  This has the effect of immediately invalidating the cache.

   The second option is to delay accepting this SOA and load new copies
   of hot cache items first.

   Note that DNS replies may contain SOA records.  If a DNS replies
   contains a SOA record with a higher serial number then the proxy
   updates its copy of the SOA records using one of the two techniques
   descibed above.

5.  Aggressive negative caching

   A caching proxy is allowed to generate negative responses (NODATA or
   NXDOMAIN) based on information in NSEC or NSEC3 records.  Obviously
   this can be done only for DNSSEC signed zones, and NXDOMAIN only for
   NSEC or NSEC3 without opt-out.

6.  ENDS Client Subnet Option

   A proxy MAY support RFC 7871 (Client Subnet in DNS Queries).  Support
   is optional because many authoritative server have no need to know
   the IP address of the client.

   If the proxy supports ECS, it SHOULD be disabled by default.  The
   reason is that ECS sends privacy sensitive data over the internet.

   A proxy that does not support ECS or where ECS support is disabled
   MUST not send queries upstream that contain the ECS option.  In
   addition, the proxy MUST NOT send replies that contain an ECS option.
